# Code on the Rocks 
At Code on the Rocks (COTR) our mission is to enable developers to code fluently in every programming language. We create tools and resources to help you apply your high-level programming knowledge in any code base.

## COTR Snippets
This VS Code extension provides a large list of generic snippets that can be used in any project, regardless of the language used. 

How does it work? 

Its very simple, actually. A language snippets file is created for every supported language with all of the snippets implementations. For example, the `dart.json` snippet file implements all of the snippets in Dart while the `typescript.json` file implements all of the snippets in TypeScript. The key is that the snippet names are consistent across languages so you only need to remember the COTR snippet name.

## Supported Languages
- Dart
- JavaScript
- JavaScript React (JSX)
- TypeScript
- TypeScript React (TSX)
