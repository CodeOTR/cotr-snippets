# Code on the Rocks 
At [Code on the Rocks](https://codeontherocks.dev/) (COTR) our mission is to enable developers to code fluently in every programming language. We create tools and resources to help you apply your high-level programming knowledge in any code base.

## COTR Snippets
This VS Code extension provides a large list of generic snippets that can be used in any project, regardless of the language used. 

How does it work? 

Its very simple, actually. A snippets file is created for every supported language with all of the snippets implementations. For example, the `dart.json` snippet file implements all of the snippets in Dart while the `typescript.json` file implements all of the snippets in TypeScript. **The key is that the snippet names are consistent across languages so you only need to remember the COTR snippet name**.
